* General 
** What is top half and bottom half of a kernel?
- Sometimes to handle an interrupt, a substantial amount of work has to
  be done.
- But it conflicts with the speed required for an interrupt
  handler. To handle this situation, Linux splits the handler into two
  parts - /Top Half/ and /Bottom Half/.
- The top half is the routine that actually responds to the
  interrupt. The bottom half on the other hand is a routine that is
  scheduled by the upper half to be executed later at a safer time.
- All interrupts are enable during execution of the bottom half.
- The top half saves the device data into specific buffer, schedules
  bottom half and exits. The bottom half does the rest. This way the
  top half can service a new interrupt while the bottom half is
  working on the previous.
